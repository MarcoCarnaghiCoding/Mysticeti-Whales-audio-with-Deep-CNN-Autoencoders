# Mysticeti-Whales-audio-with-Deep-CNN-Autoencoders

Project aimed to develop Deep Learning models to generate Data aumentation of submarine audio recordings.

Different initiatives regarding submarina mammarians are interested in using the audio recordings of this species to understand their behaviour. However, the data samples are sparse and hard to obtained. Moreover, the analysis of animals behaviour based on audio samples is a challenging task with numerous variables. Then, AI technique have emerged as an appealing alternative. Nevertheless, the lack of the needed volume of data to train those models has limited their applicability.

In this context, our objective was to generate Autoencoders to generate synthetic audio samples for data aumentation.

In the repository, you will find 3 articles that fully describe the context, development, train and validation of these models, both from raw data and using Transfer learning.
